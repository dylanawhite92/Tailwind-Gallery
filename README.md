# Tailwind Gallery

Creating an image gallery app with React that integrates the Tailwind CSS framework and pulls from the Pixabay creative community API.

### Why Use Tailwind?

Tailwind is a utility-based CSS framework that assists with building web applications with an emphasis on speed, and less time spent on writing custom CSS. Other frameworks, like Bootstrap, provide predefined components that resist easy customization. With Tailwind, you get to exert your own level of customization on components of your choice.

Tailwind involves adding many classes to HTML components. Normally, I prefer to use as few classes as possible when styling code because I like to try to be as clean and readable as possible. Tailwind is not the framework for that.

I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone and trying a different approach by using Tailwind to see if I like it. If I don't, then at least I still tried something new! If I do, I add a tool to my toolbox.
